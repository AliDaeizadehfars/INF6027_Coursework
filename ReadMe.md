### Instructions for Running the R Code
#### Loading the Data
To load the data, place the dataset file (dataset.csv) in the same folder as the R code. 
Then, execute the command provided in the "Loading the Data" section.
#### Running the Analysis
To run the analysis, ensure the code is executed in the correct order, as some variables used in later analyses were created and defined in earlier sections.
The code is divided into sections for the reader's convenience, allowing you to expand or collapse each section using the headings for easier navigation.

In the "Splitting the Data" section, ensure that the set.seed() command is included with the shuffling line. This makes sure that the same data is generated, allowing the results to be replicated accurately.
